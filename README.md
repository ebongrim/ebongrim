I may or may not go by many aliases, however my most prominent is **Veil**. Please address me as such.

Fill free to engage in conversation or to simply ask for some company unless if I'm alone. I won't bite.

I do not include everyone I meet or know personally as my friend nor wish to be named as such if I don't trust you well enough. This includes off the platform.

Majority of my time, I roam within the PonyTown **Bakery**, **Call of Duty**, and **Sonic the Hedgehog** areas intending to wait for my ingame companions, or to move away from crowded areas. Something that most should be aware of.
